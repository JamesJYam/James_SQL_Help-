/*THINGS TO REMEMBER: 

1. When in doubt, do 1 piece at a time (join, etc) doing too much in 1 step may cause trouble

2. Map out your connections (table to table, data column to data column)... this will save you time and paticence 

3. I am not a complete coder, just getting data to manipulate, sometimes, get it close and use excel to complete the job. 

4. Know what data you are looking at: get an understanding of tables, databases, rows, columns in order to move quicker. 

5. Test pieces of your code as you build, it will save headaches for #1. 


Syntax: Use '%word%' for wildcard searches 
		Inner join: matching in both tables 
		Left (Left table in right table) 
		Right (Right table to left table) 

If you are having issues, make sure to check the type of data (numerical, text, etc) and make sure connections are compatible.
